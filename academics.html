               <h2>The APEX Global Academy Philosophy</h2>
               <p>
                   The demand for online education will continue to grow in the future, and APEX Global Academy is prepared to meet this demand. Our curriculum is carefully designed to both prepare students for the rigor of university study and allow them to succeed in the online environment. At APEX we believe that strong student-instructor relationships are essential to the success of the curriculum. We emphasize forming these meaningful connections as a way to personalize the learning space. This allows instructors to pay attention to students’ strengths and weaknesses and understand their individual learning styles. Additionally, teachers and mentors provide extensive personalized feedback to both hold students accountable for the quality of their work and encourage them to improve. The student’s learning pace depends entirely upon the student and the goals they set for themselves.
               </p>
               <p>
                   As a APEX Global Academy student or parent, you’ll see that one of the primary goals of our academic program is to promote lifelong learning. Our program is designed to help students acquire the knowledge and 21st-century skills necessary for future success in their chosen field. Included in these skills are critical thinking, understanding, discrimination in reading and listening, creativity, initiative, and collaboration. Students also gain the tools for completing academic research throughout their coursework.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Each student is required to pursue a course of study encompassing English, social studies, science, mathematics, physical education, and health. Students develop individualized learning profiles that allow our staff to personalize the curriculum to meet their needs. A variety of electives are also offered to enhance the students’ skills and interests in areas including art, music, computer science, industrial technology, and business. As a result, students benefit from getting their high school diploma in a way that would not be possible in a mainstream school. From enrollment to post-graduation, students are guided by their Home Advisors, College Counselors, and instructors to ensure that they are pursuing a path that suits their individual goals.

                               APEX offers students who have already graduated high school the opportunity to participate in a post-graduate program. Post graduate high school programs, also referred to as  academically-minded gap-year programs, are increasingly popular among students who want to strengthen their academic credentials or simply postpone their university decision for another year. Our post-graduate program allows students to cultivate their academic and social skills

                               Appropriate selection of courses will provide a challenging curriculum that fits each student’s ability level. The student's Home Advisor will coordinate with the College Counselor and the student in order to make course selections. Parental approval is required prior to completing registration. Once course selections are made, the decisions are final. Class changes due to teacher preference are not permitted.

                            <p>
                               Students who are gifted or academically talented need a qualitatively different program that takes their advanced learning abilities into consideration. The Honors Program at APEX provides a challenge for these students and develops their skills in independent study, research, creativity, and critical thinking. Honors courses allow for a more in-depth approach to the content, more discussion-based activities, and the chance for higher-level thinking that focuses on the analysis and synthesis of knowledge. Honors students will be challenged to develop their abilities for both their own personal growth and the benefit of society.
